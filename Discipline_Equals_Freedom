1. **The shortcut is a lie.** 

To reach your goals and overcome obstacles and become the best version of you possible will not happen by itself. It will not happen by cutting corners, taking shortcuts, or looking for the easy way. 

There’s not easy way.

There’s only hard work, late nights, early mornings, practices, rehearsal, repetition, study, sweat, blood, toil, frustration, and discipline

Discipline - The root of all good qualities. The driver of daily execution. The core principle that overcomes laziness and lethargy and excuses.

2. **Where does the discipline come from ?**

Discipline comes from within. Discipline is an internal force.

Make the commitment.

Become the discipline - embrace its cold and relentless power. And it will make you better, stronger, smarter, faster, healthier than anything else. 

3. **When and where to start**

Where do I start ? 

When do I start ?

The simple answer is : “Here and Now”

That’s it

You want to improve ?

You want to get better ?

You want to write a book or build a house or an app ?

Where do I start ? You start right - “Here”

When do I start ? You start right - “Now”

You initiate action.

You Go

Because :

That idea isn’t going to execute itself. 

That book isn’t going to write itself. 

*You have to do it.*

*Go After it*

*Here and Now*

4. **The person you can control**

People are not who you want them to be. 

See what not to do.

Because you can’t control other people. You can’t make them what you want them to be. You can’t make them who you want them to be.

The only person you can control is yourself. So focus on making yourself who you want to be :

*“Faster, Stronger, Smarter, More Humble, Less Ego, Discipline your body, Free your mind, Get up early, and Go*

*Get After it and you will become the person you want to be. And you become that person through :*

*One-Small-Decision-At-A-Time “* 

5. **Mind Control**

“How do I get tougher ?”                                                                                                                     Be tougher

“How can you wake up early in the morning ?”                                                                            Wake up EARLY

“How can i stop eating sugar ?”
Stop eating sugar

“How can i work-out consistently everyday day ?”                                                                         Work our Consistently Everyday                 

You have control over your mind. You just have to assert it. You have to decide that you are going to be in control, that you are going to do what YOU want to do. 

Weakness doesn’t get a vote. Laziness doesn’t get a vote. Sadness doesn’t get a vote. Frustration doesn’t get a vote. NEGATIVITY doesn’t get a vote. 
So next time, you are feeling weak or lazy or emotional, tell those feelings they don’t get vote. 

You are declaring marital law on your mind :

MIND CONTROL

Impose what you want on your brain :

DISCIPLINE
POSITITVITY
WILL
PERSEVERANCE
PASSION
CONSISTENCY

6. **Stress**

Humans can withstand almost inconceivable stress and YOU can too.

So that’s your first step : Gain Perspective

And to do that you must do something critical in many situations : Detach

Whatever problems or stress you are experiencing, detach from them.

Stress is generally caused by what you can’t control. The worst thing about incoming artillery fire is you can’t control it. It is happening and you just have to accept it. Don’t stress about things you can’t control. 

If the stress is something that you control and you are not, that is a lack of of discipline and a lack of ownership.

Get control of it. Impose your will to make it happen. Solve the problem. Relieve Stress.

If the stress is something you can’t control : Embrace it

How can you look at it from a different angle ?

How can you use it to your advantage ?

Make it into your ally.

So. Don’t fight stress. Embrace it. Use it to make yourself sharper and more alert. Use it to make you think and learn and get better and stronger and smarter and more effective.

Use the stress to make you a better YOU
